I would like a transfer to eMalahleni campus, this are my specialization (IT) Communication Network I would to be do Software Development.
The reason for the transfer is that I am going to stay at home with my mother because I was mugged twice within 2 months, so I no longer feel safe in Soshanguve and because of that my academic performance is suffering.  Approval of this transfer will be high appreciated.
Campus is closer to home town.  Expenses will be less, meaning more time spent on school work.  Specialization:  Software development for 2015 for it is the only one offered at this campus.
My family has relocated to Nelspruit, so I'll be staying home with my family.
My dad was retrenched at work so I won't be able to pay for my accommodation.  I will be staying at home in Polokwane when I transfer to the Polokwane Campus.
I hereby apply for a transfer because my grandmother (guardian) lives on her own and for which I have to travel on weekends to check up on her, and I spend a lot on transport to go home.  The rent money is also a problem since she is not working (lives on social grant) and it is sometimes affecting my studies, because when she is sick I can't attend her nor help her since I'm far from her, and she's been the person who has supported me ever since.  Polokwane is my home city and I won't be spending a lot of money as I do in Witbank.  I even missed my supplementary test due to my medical attention, as my doctor (Dr) is around my place.
"Due to illness, my academic performance has depreciated throughout the year.  I frequently have to go home to undergo treatments.  As such I believe It would be best for my education if I study from a campus closer to home.

I am asking for transfer because I have been at home since I have failed my FPIDS01.  So I have decided to get a part-time job where I can be able to pay my fees because I didn't get NSFAS this year and I can be able to pay rent with that money as my mother she is a pensioner she can't afford to do it all for me, so by this salary I am getting at my work place I can be able to pay my fees and further my studies.  And I promise my job won't disturb me on my studies.  I will appreciate your approval.
Strike at this campus is affecting my academic performance so this transfer enhance my performance and help me get better at what I do.
My brother had a car accident and he cannot afford my accommodation at my current campus as I am staying off campus.  I have free accommdation at eMalahleni Campus where I can stay while studying there and my home is very near eMalahleni Campus.  I did not register for first semester because I am attending treatment after being diagnosed with a medical condition.
My parents encouraged me to do a transfer just because they often fail to attend meeting for parents as the institution invites parents in some meetings.  eMalahleni Campus is close to my home town and I can be able to visit my family since at times I wish to be with them and I fail to see them because I am far away from them.  I understand I have to stand and be independent but I love my parents and I miss them and my siblings.  I know I will be more encouraged academically when I am always around them.
I am asking to transfer because some of the subject they don't offer it in my campus.  They don't offer ISY34AT and DSO34AT.
I have secured in-service training in Pretoria, therefore it will be easier for me to be at the Soshanguve Campus in terms of commuting back and forth.  Also, in terms of a place to rent, I will be staying with a relative in Pretoria.  I also wish to do my in-service training concurrently with TPG201T
DSO34BT subject not running in eMalahleni campus semester 2 2017.
I want a transfer because I want to do DSO34BT next semester and it is not offered in our campus I am only left with one subject to finish my diploma.  If I am not registered in another campus it will mean that I have to stay at home for the whole six months.
I want a transfer because I will be left with DSO34BT only and it will not be running next semester on eMalahleni Campus.
I am pleading for a transfer to Soshanguve because my parents stay near Soshanguve.  I need to stay with my parents because I have a sickness consition which needs to be monitored time to time.  I need supervision of my parents because of my sickness, I need to be taken care of.  I have consulting many clinics, hospitals and doctors here at eMalahleni.  I didn't find help.  Instead they gave me pills which had terrrible side effects on my body.  My tongue was undergoing in a paralysis, my eyes were twitching.  I lost focus on my studies.  I tried to study very hard because I love my studies, I want to pass very well.  Your approval will be highly appreciated.
I have only one subject left and I got an internship at Pretoria and I stay at Kwamhlanga which is closer to Soshanguve.  So it's a problem to travel from home to Witbank and I can't afford to stay at Witbank due to financial problems.
I am only left with two subjects which is DSO34AT and DSO34BT.  I also reside in Germiston so I think it would be more convenient if I travel from home to Sosha Campus.  Rent is also expensive to travel from Germiston to eMalahleni would be a cost.  So I think it would be beneficial for me to finish in Pretoria where there are more opportunities for ICT.  So please consider my application I need it.
I am only left with DSO34BT and it is not going to be offered in our campus next semester.  I feel like I cannot waist the next six months doing nothing since I won't be allowe to procedd with IDC30BT.
The financial assistant that I have applied for has not responded yet and currently am staying in a rental commune of which my parents are finding hard to pay for.  I can't stay at the resident because I won't be able to pay.  Moving to Soshanguve would be close to home and I won't have to worry paying for a place to stay.
I want to change campus because I want to do Communication Networks next year which is offered only at Soshanguve South Campus.  I don't want to do Software Development for my second year.  So I hope my application form will be approved because I do reach the requirement for Communication Networks.
My family moved from where I stay to Johannesburg due to my father's situation.  My father is working in Joburg and now is suffering from headache that's the reason my family decided to move to Joburg.  New home address:  921 Eel Lane, Alex Mews, Alexandra, 2090.  My reason taking a transfer is to be closer to my family.
It is closer to home and is a wise financial decision for my parents.
Student are currently registered for foundation subjects and need to finish it at eMalahleni campus before applying for transfer to Soshanguve South Campus.
I am applying for a transfer from Polokwane to Soshanguve since I got an internship in Johannesburg and I relocated to Johannesburg.  It will make simle for me to register my IDC outstanding subject.
All aspects TUT seem to embrace learning.  Guidance from faculty members and challenges from peer within TUT create a setting in which I can pursue current interests and discover new one while simultaneously discovering my future direction due to insufficient funds my constant failure in specific subject and health complication.  I tried applying for NSFAS for assistant but their reject my request.  May you please consider my transfer because if not I will have to put my studies on hold until my financial problem is solved which is not quarantee.

The reason why I am applying for the transfer, it is because here at Witbank the living cost are too high.  I can't afford the accommodation and even the transport.  When I am in Polokwane Campus, I will be living at home and I will not pay for the accommodation.  I will pay for the transport only.  I will appreciate that if you can transfer me to Polokwane Campus.  Yours faithfully.
I only have one subject left (TPG20I) which is equivalent to TPG20AT and TPG20BT in the Software Engineering and I am willing to do both.  I cannot afford accommodation here and no longer qualify to live in campus residence.  Polokwane campus is closer to home and with in walking distance from my home.
My reason of changing a campus is that I want to stay with my family at home who can motivate and support me each and everyday.  Due to the constraints that I am facing on this campus such as strikes.  I don't adapt to the environment and I am not financially stable.  So when I go home to home and come to school during recess, it is hard to get money for transport.
I will be staying in Pretoria from next year (2015).  I am moving there so travelling from Pretoria to Witbank will be too expensive for me.  I won't be able to afford it.  I also do not have enough money to rent a place at Witbank.
I'll be closer to home and save money for the accommodation since I will be doing one subject.
My mom is not able to pay for my rent anymore, so I have to move to stay at my brother's house.  Also been told by my brother that there are so many opportunities of IT students that side.
I, Thokozani Masango, and I would like to be transferred from eMalahleni to Soshanguve Campus, because I have particularly interested in Road Traffic and Municipal Police Management course that is under the Faculty of Humanities and second choice I Policing I would be grateful for the opportunity for 2015.
I, the person mentioned above, want to be transferred from eMalahleni Campus to Soshanguve  Campus.  Since eMalahleni Campus offer specialization field of Software Development in ICT, I am interested in Communication Networks and it is only offered at Soshanguve  Campus.  I ask for a transfer because of what I want to pursue my career with which is Communication Networks.  I plead for my application to be approved.
The reason why I want to transfer is because eMalahleni Campus only specialize in Software Development.  I would like to pursue the course specialization in Support Services.
The field of Information Technology that I'm interested in is not available which is Technical Applications (NDILF1).  I would like to pursue the field of my choice at Soshanguve Campus so I can continue and go further with my studies.
"I have two reasons:
First reason
My family is relocating to the City of Tshwane and they want me to be closer to them.
Second reason
I need to change my current specialization which is Software Development to Support Services because am good with everything that has to do with Support Service.  I would be glad if my transfer will be approved.  Thank you for you time."
"I am generously asking for a transfer from eMalahleni Campus to Soshanguve  Campus.
Reason for transfer:
I need to change my current specialization which is Software Development to Support Services which they don't offer at eMalahleni Campus.
I would be happy if my transfer is accepted."
Due to shortages of other courses at eMalahleni Campus in the Department of Information and Communication Technology.  I am eager to further my career in Intelligent Industrial.  Lastly but not least I hope my application will be successfully.
"I the person mentioned above, ask for a transfer from eMalahleni Campus to Soshanguve  Campus.  I ask for a transfer under this reasons:
I want to specialize with Communication Network and it is only offered at Soshanguve  Campus.  Since I am a first year student, I established my interest in Communication Network.  I hope my transfer will be approved."
I want to apply for transfer because here at eMalahleni Campus on the Faculty of ICT, they only offer Software Development and it is not my choice.  I want to do Communication Networks which is at Soshanguve Campus.  Regarding residential I will apply for campus residence on November.  I will be glad if you accept my application.
I want to do Support Service of which is not offered at eMalahleni Campus.
As a TUT student I would like to uphold my school's honour and my own by making a mark on technology.  I believe my full potential will be unleashed in a field that specializes in both hardware and software technologies.  Therefore I believe the field of Intelligent Industrial Systems will help me achieve my dreams and give my school even greater honour.
This transfer is due to lack of qualification course in eMalahleni Campus.  I am prepared to do Information Technology:  Intelligent Industrial Systems which is not available in eMalahleni Campus.  It's only available at Soshanguve  Campus.
"* The eMalahleni Campus does not provide
   for a department I would like to pursue a
   career in which is NATIONAL DIPLOMA:  
   ENGINEERING COMPUTER SYSTEMS.
* The campus is far from home which lead
   me to rent for accommodation and my 
   family is not financial stable."
As from the second year, I want the field of specialization that is Communication Networks only offered at Soshanguve  Campus.
I want to follow my passion which is Web Design during my time to specialize and is at Soshanguve  Campus.  eMalahleni Campus only offer Software Development which I don't like and I'm not good at.
I will have many opportunities there as there are many courses if I would like to change my course and I will be closer to my family.
Field of interest is not available in eMalahleni Campus so due to that I am forced to move to Soshanguve  Campus to do Communication Networks.
I am humbly asking for a transfer because I am having financial challenges.  My mother is unemployed and my father is having financial challenges.  The only income that me, my sister and my mother depend on is the maintenance fee we get from my father (prove of income is attached).  As I reside at 331 Block A, Mabopane, 0190, which is near the Soshanguve  Campus (prove of residence is attached), living at home for next year (2015) would help my mother.  In terms of paying school fees hence I am having difficulties to pay rent, for transport and to buy groceries.  Studying from home would really make things easy/less difficult for me.  (Prove of my mother's unemployment, and financial assistance is attached too).
"I am applying for transfer, because here I can't afford to pay for rent.  Is very expensive.  The person who pays rent for me is my uncle and he stays at Pretoria.  So I want to move and stay with him at Pretoria to make things easy.  There at Pretoria it will be closer to Soshanguve  Campus and I will use school bus to travel.
Another thing which is very important is that I was thinking of doing Communication Networks when I do my third year.  They only offered Communication Networks at Soshanguve  Campus.  Hoping for the best."
Tshwane is closer to home and relatives.  It has also come to my attention that this campus only offers Software Development and I do not wish to do it.  I wish to do Networking and I think is better if I begin my first year in Soshanguve to adapt to the environment.
I would love to transfer to Soshanguve  Campus, because my passion in Information technology field is to study Intelligent Industrial System.  Since it is not offered in eMalahleni.  My last reason is, I will be staying at home and this will reduce my expenses since I am raised by a single mother.  I hope my request will be met, so that I can pursue my passion.
"* Need to be closer to home.
* Desire to specialize in Intelligent Industrial
  System.
* First semester I applied for the transfer, I
  received it and I couldn't submit required
  documents.
* Facing challenges with Development

My goal is to pursue my career as a Computer Engineer.  The problem is hear at eMalahleni they do not offer such course.  It is only offered at Soshanguve  Campus.  That is why I would love to be accepted for the transfer, so that I could make my dream com through, and also be able to do what I love, and what I have passion for.
I hereby request for relocation to Soshanguve.  This is due to the lack of courses under the ICT Faculty.  I am interested in Computer System Engineering which is not offered at eMalahleni Campus but at Soshanguve  Campus.
I would like to go to Soshanguve  Campus because I would love to do Web and Application Development next year, 2015.  I am a creative, hardworking and dedicated student.  With these qualities of mine I do think that I will excel in Web and Application Development.
I will be closer to my family and I will be exposed to many opportunities in case I want to change my course.
I am applying for transfer because I am having a problem with the money to pay rent, so at least at Pretoria I'll apply for residence in the campus or stay with my sister since she also stays at Pretoria.  I'll be glad if you can approve my request because this rent issue is giving met trouble and I can't concentrate on my studies.
My brother stays at Pretoria so my parents want me to be closer to him, because he is taking care of me.  So I have to move next year and TUT Polokwane campus offers only one option and I want to do Networking next year.
The reason I want to transfer from Polokwane Campus to Soshanguve  Campus is because of the specialization subjects that I want to choose in 2015 that are offered at Soshanguve  Campus.  I want to do Support Services during my second year for specialization.  Support Services is not offered at the Polokwane Campus.  Only Software Development is offered and I do not want to do Software Development, therefore I must change campus next year.
"I am willing to take a transfer in concern of changing course from Development Software to Communication Network as we know that in Polokwane Campus they only offer Development Software.  I will appreciate it if my application is accepted.
Thank you in advance.
Rambuwani D"
My reasons for why I'm taking a transfer is because the course I want to do isn't available in Polokwane Campus.  Thus the only chance that I have is to take a transfer which will enhance the opportunity of doing my own course that I can relate and perform well in it.
The course that I want to specialize with is not available here in Polokwane Campus.
