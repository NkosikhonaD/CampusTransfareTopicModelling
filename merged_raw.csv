Academic;I would like to change my specialisation field. I am not interested in Studying Software Development. I want to study Information Technology that specialize in Business because I am interested in that field of Information Technology Business Apllication and it is not offered on this current campus I am registered at now. The only TUT campus that offer that course is the soshanguve campus and that is why I will like to be transfer there to study it.;Declined;2014
Family;My family is moving out from Witbank to Gauteng;Declined;2014
Academic;I am currently doing DSO17BT and some 3rd year subjects. I still need to do the TPG's and DSO's. the only subject available for me to do next semester is IDC30BT and it is said that you cannot do IDC30BT if you still have 2 or 3 subjects to do, like me. The reason why I want to go to Soshanguve is because I want to start doing the TPG's and DSO's since I am only left with them. If I stay here I will not be able to register any subject since AT's are only done in January - June - first semester.;Approved;2014
Academic;I have registered DSO17BT and some of the 3rd year subjects and next semester I don't have any subjects availaable for me to register. Therefore the only subject that will be available it is IDC30BT which I cannot be able to register because I am still left with other subjects to complete.;Declined;2014
Family;My brother (Mokone TA, 213555227) and I were sharing everything, including laptop) last year, when we were both studying at the eMalahleni campus. And since he was transferred to soshanguve campus due to the field of specialisatin, it has been a struggle for my family to accomodate 2 separate expenses . since I am interested to specialise in Intelligent Industrial Systems, I will be pleased if you consider my request so that my brother and I will continue to share.;Approved;2014
Family;I would like to move to main campus because of my financial status at home. In soshanguve I would be staying with my grandmother. Another reason being that I want to specialise in the field of Business applications. Here in this campus their don't offer this specialisation.;Approved;2014
Academic;After careful and considered thinking I see that the course / specialisesfield that I want to persue is not offered at this current campus where I am situated and although all first years go through the same subject before branching out to a specific I feel that a second semester move will repa positive results in that I am moving to a new area while the workload is barely at its peak as oppose to when its harder next year. The move might prove distractful. I want to specialise in Business applications and I kindly ask that you consider my transfer request. ;Declined;2014
Academic;Reason for transfer is because I want to specialize in Network and not programming.  Soshanguve campus is nearer to home and nearer to my skin specialist (dermatologist).  I go for check up now and then.  It is costly.  Travelling now and then for check up is affecting my parents' budget as well as my monthly allowance.  A transfer to Soshanguve Campus would help a lot in terms of check ups, budget and my field of speciality.  It will also save time from traveling a distance.;Declined;2014
Academic;eMalahleni campus will not offer TPG11AT/BT and DSO23AT next semester, whereas these subjects are offered at Soshanguve.;Declined;2014
Family;I request to transfer because eMalahleni Campus will not offer TPG and DSOIIA in the forth coming semester, whereas the subjects are offered at the Soshanguve Campus.;Approved;2014
Family;My brother stays in Pretoria (see prove in the next page).  I need this transfer because he's also paying for my study fees.  If I get transferred, he won't spend a lot of money any more because now he pays rent for me and buy me grocery every month.  Please approve my transfer to reduce financial problems in my family cause my brother is the only guy that is supporting me.;Declined;2014
Family;A am formally requesting a transfer to Soshanguve Campus.  My reason for requesting a transfer is that, my sister has moved to Pretoria, so I want to go stay with her, because in Witbank I am spending a lot of money.  Next year I would also like to find myself in the field of Intelligent Industrial Systems or Business Applications.  I would be very grateful if you consider my application.;Approved;2014
Family;Socially and economically.  Here I am living on disorganised environment and community.  I feel neglected here because I don't have family member.  Here I am renting a room of R800 while my father is unemployed.  There I'll stay with my family and I'll be using a train which is R150 per month than paying R800 per month and I'll be staying at hostel for free.;Declined;2014
Family;The reason of my motivation from wanting to move from Witbank Campus to Soshanguve Campus, its because of financial problems.  My family is staying here at Atteridgeville in Pretoria, and Witbank is far, so my grandmother can't afford to pay for me rent and school fees.  Because she is a street vendor and I don't have Nasfas to pay my fees, so this issue even had me to drop out.  If I can continue to study at Witbank Campus because of financial problems, I will be grateful if my request can begranted.;Declined;2014
Family;Financial reasons, whereby accommodation is expensive around Witbank whilst I have family whom I can reside at for the remaining duration of my qualification at this Institution.  I have a paternal aunt resides at 4103 Rolfus Street, Ext 21, The Orchards. 0182.  Who have accepted accommodating me till I complete my course.  Reference:  Morongwa Pelpo 081 036 8409 or 084 788 8508.;Approved;2014
Family;I am from Soshanguve, and unfortunately I couldn't study at Soshanguve Campus as it was full by the time I applied.  I would like to study at Soshanguve Campus as I will be staying at home and NOT paying any accommodation and I have a relative who studied the same course as I, so I will be having someone to mentor me full time.;Approved;2014
Family;I am making a request to be transferred to Soshanguve Campus since I am having money problems.  I am having a single-parent (mother) who is earning not enough money for family expenses.  She does not have enough money to pay for the place I am staying at, buy me food and then home expenses.  My mother suggested that she can stop suffering next semester if I go to Soshanguve Campus.  I will be staying with my aunt.  Mo mother's expenses will then be less.  I will be so glad if you approve my transfer so that my mother will stop suffering.  Thank you.;Declined;2014
Family;My parents are struggeling with the expensive rent here in Witbank.  I am currently paying      R1 500 per sharing a room.  I stay far from the campus and it is not easy for me to access the library as I wish.  I have an aunt staying in Soshanguve Block L.  It will be walking to campus and I will be able to access the library as I wish and that could improve my academics.;Declined;2014
Family, Academic and Security;There are a number of issues that leads me to need this transfer.  Firstly I do not have a bursary and the way things  are going I will end up being a drop out.  If I can go to Soshanguve Campus, it will be better deu to that I can travel with my father because he also work at Pretoria and that will be less costly.  Secondly, I cannot perform well because I spend much time in the bus than studying.  Thirdly, it is safety, it is not safe where I live right now.  I will appreciate it if I can get this transfer.  I really need this to fulfil my dreams and goals.  Thank you. ;Declined;2014
health;I am a person who usually get ill, and I am alone here.  At least Pretoria is home, it can encounter problems if I can not get immediate help.  I struggle to find accommodation, which makes me stressed up an it affect my studies.  Where I stay here in Witbank, I stay far from school and I don't get money to come to library.  So at Soshanguve everything will be easy since it is near my home and I won't get stressed anymore.  Again my academic will improve.;Approved;2014
Academic;I am intending to study Communication Networks and in my current campus only Software Development is offered.  My current campus is located in a more urban area and unfortunately I did not get accommodation at the campus residence therefore its very hard for me to find a more affordable place.  My parents cannot afford to pay that kind of money for rent where as I will be staying at home in Soshanguve South.;Declined;2014
Family and Finance;I am staying far from Witbank and my mother can not afford to pay my rent since it is expensive.  It would be better if I stay near home to school.  Again it is no longer safe here in Witbank for me because they are some guys who are stalking me and threathening to kill me, I have opened a case but its not enough since I nolonger feel safe even to walk on street by myself.;Approved;2014
Family and Finance;I, student number 214189143 Thabang Phoku, would like to be transferred to the abovementioned campus due to the following circumstances:  A am originally from Gauteng in Soshanguve and it is close to the abovementioned campus as well as my family.  I did not yet recieved a bursary to pay for my school fees as well as residence and this is putting financial strain on my parents as they are paying for my stay, grocery and stationary (books), etc. and the cost of living for the campus where I am currently residing is expensive compared to that of my area and the new campus.  If I get transferred this will definitely help a lot.;Declined;2014
Familty and Finance;I am humbly asking for a transfer because I am having financial challenges.  My mother is unemployed and my father is having financial challenges.  I reside at 19686 Ext 10, Soshanguve South, 0152, a letter from Home Affairs as prove is attached.  I am going to have difficulties to pay for rent, transport and buy groceries because my father was only able to pay for my first semester, so my mother will have to pay for everything, including my second semester fees hence my father is paying maintenace for me and my sister.  Studying from home (Soshanguve) would help my mother in terms of the fees from my second semester and next year.  Prove of maintenance is attached too.;Declined;2014
Health;I feel that this transfer will be very beneficial to me mainly because I am a student that is diagnosed with migraine so it will be much easier for me to get access to my doctors whenever I may be sick.  And at least Soshanguve Camps is much closer from my home (Kempton Park).  Rent here at Witbank is too expensive, if I am at home I'll be travelling and instead of paying rent.   I will be paying less.  Next year I will be specializing in Intelligent Industrial Systems. ;Declined;2014
Family;My parents are living in Pretoria.  I would like to be transferred to be closer to my family and friends.  Proof of residence is attached along with a certified copy of my fathers' ID.;Approved;
Finance;The reason behind this transfer is that I am unable to cope on my school work.  I am originally from Limpopo and my background is unstable, so sometimes during school holidays I am unable to go home because of the amount of money required from me.  I believe that if I'm close to home I will be releaved and I would not have to worry about my financial issues, and also that my performance will be better.;Declined;2014
Social;My main motivation for the transfer is for me to improve academically as I am now used to my current campus, so I feel that if I move to another campus and get away from my close friends here in Pretoria, then I can start afresh and do well academically like I did with my first year passing all my subjects and other thing is that I don't use NSFAS and I stay away from Soshanguve, so I pay for bus, so it will be an advantage for me because my father stays and work in Polokwane.;Declined;2014
Finance;I was admitted here in Soshanguve campus but now I want to attend at Polokwane campus. I am a first year student and next year I want to choose Software Development as my specialisation which is there in Polokwane.My parents cannot affort to pay rentso I want to stay with them in Polokwane. ;Declined;2014
Family;I am going to Polokwane just because it is near to where my parents are.;Declined;2014
Finance;I need transfer because I am having a problem with the money to pay rent and I am not coping.  My sister is staying in Pretoria so at least I will be staying with her until I complete my course.;Declined;2014
Academic;I, J Hendricks, hereby request a transfer to TUT Soshanguve South Campus because I want to study Support Services, which is not offered at Polokwane Campus.  This will help me to study in a field that I have always admired and interested into.  It will also give me chance to be able to finish all my qualifications without moving from one campus to another after graduating for diploma.;Approved;2014
Academic;Soshanguve Campus offers my specialization and I am more aware of the resources that side compared to this side.  Also I will be closer to home thus accommodation will be less cheaper and transport fees will be minimized.;Declined;2014
Social;My parents chaned provinces and I am left alone here in Polokwane.  It will be difficult for me to continue with my studies here in Polokwane.  I would like to continue with my studies at Soshanguve Campus.  Another reason is that I am pregnant girl who is due soon.  So I really need to be close to my parents for them to take care of me and the new baby.  I would appreciate if you approve my application.  Thank you.;Declined;2014
Finance;Living away from home has been strenias and stressful.  Lately expecially now that we're going through a financial crisis, my parents can no longer afford to sustain me as I living away from home has been very costly.  As a result, my academic work has suffered a great deal and my results have been proof of that.  A transfer is exactly what I need and I would highly appreciated it if this transfer can go through smoothly.;Approved;2014
Social;I am a student who transferred to Soshanguve this semester due to financial problems at home, since I was staying with my aunt at her place in Soshanguve.  Unfortunately after a few weeks of illness, I lost my aunt and therefore I cannot stay there anymore.  I would like to remain with Software Development.;Declined;2014
Social;I Prudence Potlake Malete, 212441619, wish to transfer back to eMalahleni Campus.  My mom got very sick at home and this affected my studies and even my progress report would account for this.  I would love to return hom to eMalahleni as I would be living at home and be able to look after my mother and study at the same time.  I hope to find a positive response on this issue.;Approved;2014
Finance;I am struggeling financial which affect me academically so eMalahleni campus is near home.  There will be no need to pay rent and I will be close to my family.;Approved;2014
Accommodation;I'm currently experiencing accommodation problems since I was not accepted at the residence.  Thus on daily basis it is a problem to travel back and forth to the campus, since I reside at a distant place.  I'm also suffering academically due to not being close to the library at all times to access the facilities provided on campus for our benefits.  I've chosen the Polokwane campus because it is much closer to my home and cost effective and also for all my academic progress.;Declined;2014
Family;"I am facing personal problems in which my
parent is faced with a medical condition
that requires assistance, care as well as
support.  Under the current circumstances
I am forced to go back and live home but I
still have the desire to study further.  The
Polokwane campus is closer to home so it will
give me an opportunity to study and still be
able too provide all the necessary support
required at home.";Approved;2016
Academic;"The current course offered in Polokwane wasn't
the course I was hoping to do.  The course I was
hoping to do is Business Applications";Declined;2016
Family and Finance;"My parents suggested that I finish my course
here in Soshanguve because it is close to home
and my living situation at eMalahleni wasn't
in good standards, finance and accommodation
was too much.  Me being close to home will
really simplify thing for my family and I and
whenever they want to come check on me it
will be much easier.";Declined;2016
Academic;"I have been having difficulties in completing 
DSO17BT, I would like not to proceed studying
it in future.  I have realized that I have interest
in networking I have being doing well in it and I
would like to see myself studying what I like
and understand better.";Declined;2016
Academic;DSO34AT and BT is not offered at eMalahleni campus second semester so it being offered at Soshanguve I would be very glad if I would transfer to there.  I would like to finish my course this year, so if I stay here at eMalahleni it will not happen.  I must add an extra year.  Can you please consider my transfer application, cause that would really help me.;Declined;2016
Academic;Next semester I am suppose to be doing the following modules:  TPG201T, DSO34AT and BT, and ISY34AT, only to find that eMalahleni campus next semester those module won't be offered that is why I would like to take a transfer to Soshanguve campus.;Declined;2016
Academic;My current Campus eMalahleni, will not be offering DSO34AT and BT.  Should I pass all my currently registered subjects, I will have any more subjects to register.;Declined;2016
Academic;DSO34AT and BT and ISY34AT is not being offered next semester I can't sit at home for 6 months doing nothing I want to continue with my studies, and I have family in Soshanguve I would be closer to them.;Declined;2016
Academic;My mother is worried about my low performance merely because of the subject ISY34AT I don't qualify to write exam.  She wants me to study at home Soshanguve in order to regain my performance.;Declined;2016
Academic;I will be studying one subject ISY23BT for the whole second semester.  So I cannot afford to do only one subject where by which the other campus also offer with other subject that I need to repeat for first semester.  So I informed my family about the matter and they said its best I take a transfer in order for me to complete my course on time and they suggested that I move to my aunt who is residing at Soshanguve South at stand 18035 for matters of accommodation.  And there I will repeat my DSO23AT, TPG111T subject together with ISY23BT.;Declined;2016
Accommodation;I will be staying at 5 Morutlawa Street, Lotus Gardens 0008, I wanna move to Soshanguve because my family is reciding at Pretoria and they are struggling to pay rent and give me money for food every month and that side I will be staying at home.;Approved;2016
Family;I will be staying with my family if I move to Soshanguve.  My family is residing at Pretoria and I will be getting enough support with my studies from them.  I will be staying at 446 Block DD (Thutong Dr), Soshanguve, 0152;Declined;2016
Academic;The subjects am left with they not operating next semester on the campus I am attending now, so I cannot register for them next semester.;Declined;2016
Academic;I want to transfer back to Soshanguve because of academic reasons.  Some subjects seem to be only offered once a year in this campus which means should I fail a subject I might not be able to repeat it on the following semester but the year after.  This has already left a mark on me as I couldn't do a specific subject, this semester and it blocked other subjects.  As a semester student this is a bad thing because it has prolonged my course period.  It might happen again should it be I happen to fail or that subject is not offered in the next semester.;Declined;2016
Adacemic;The person whose responsible for paying my fees and accommodation she is a pensioner, I cant afford to study at distant campus.  The other reason is that my home is at Soshanguve, which is near campu.  As I am staying at home I will be able to walk to school.  I have a medical condistion that also requires me to be next to home and my family.;Declined;2016
Academic;I the person mentione above want to be transferred to Soshanguve South campus, because my family is relocating from eMalahleni to BushBuckRidge.  I will no longer have a place to stay while pursuing my studies at eMalahleni.  They won't afford to pay a place to stay, no money for me.  At Soshanguve I have a relative who have a house and I will be staying there with him until I complete my studies if the transfer is successful or if it will be unsuccessful I will have no choice to drop out, maybe until my family recover from debt condition that they are in.  I hope my reasons will be taken into a consideration.;Declined;2016
Finance;I am asking for transfer because I have been at home since I have failed my FPIDS01.  So I have decided to get a part-time job where I can be able to pay my fees because I didn't get NSFAS this year and I can be able to pay rent with that money as my mother she is a pensioner she can't afford to do it all for me, so by this salary I am getting at my work place I can be able to pay my fees and further my studies.
